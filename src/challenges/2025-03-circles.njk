I think this was the third try over the course of a week. The first time I thought I'd pretty much nailed it on the first take, but wasn't 100% happy with one bit.

Then on the second go I rushed the clean parts and they sounded out of time. Third time's the charm, although this time I did need about 10 takes to get all the way through and I still missed the volume knob coming out of the solo section.

Ah well. I'm pretty happy with it.

The clean tone is from Neural DSP's [Archetype: Cory Wong](https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/archetype-cory-wong) and the distortion tone is from [Archetype: Rabea](https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/archetype-rabea), and I have my Morley Bad Horsie wha on the distortion channel. I had to buy a new A/B box to do this video as my 30-year old one broke after the second attempt.

C'est la vie, innit?
