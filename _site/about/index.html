<p>Far, far back in the mists of time, beyond the reach of mortal memory<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, the Fiasco Brothers were in a band. They were 17 at the time. Then, time passed, and they were no longer in a band. More time passed, and they were once again in a band. You get the picture.</p>
<p>Nowadays they are no longer even in the same country and while they do both still play guitar, they have very few opportunities to jam together any more. This makes them sad.</p>
<p>But lo! A splendid idea was forged. Why not come up with semi-regular<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> challenges to keep them playing, and maybe even uploading video evidence to that popular video sharing site? In a spirit not of competition, but of encouragement and comradeship.</p>
<p>Something like “Hey, I reckon I can still play ‘Circles’ by Satriani. Did you ever learn that? Reckon you can still remember it? All the way through? By next weekend?”</p>
<p>And they saw that it was good.</p>

<p><strong>Cussons Fiasco</strong> was raised by wolves on the island of Kefalonia in the mid 1700s. He learnt to play guitar by watching the sailors in the port, and eventually stowed away in a rum cask and fled to Britain where he became a web developer so that he could practice his legato runs in the evenings. He is also, on occasion, known as Clive Murray.</p>
<p>Less is known about <strong>Pearl Fiasco</strong>. Some say he is a descendant of Rhodri the Great, who was famous for his sweep-picking<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>. Others believe Pearl to be the secret love-child of Brian Blessed and Joan of Arc, despite this being both unlikely <em>and</em> impossible. Whatever the case, he shreds to this day.</p>
