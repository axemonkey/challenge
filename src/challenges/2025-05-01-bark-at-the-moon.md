## May 2025: "Bark at the Moon" by Ozzy Osbourne

* **The challenge**: Jake E. Lee's magnificent octopus, "[Bark at the Moon](https://song.link/gb/i/192826926)", has been required reading for metal guitarists for around forty years. The Brothers must try to get the whole thing down in one go.

<!-- > So many takes, and something went wrong on every one! (Except the one where I forgot to record video, of course...) In this one it's the outro solo. A lot of the playing is way sloppier than I would like too, but the overall vibe is nice so I went with it.
>
> The guitar is once again the trusty Ibanez 540PII, the rhythm sound is coming from Neural DSP's [Mesa Boogie Mark IIC+](https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/tone-king-imperial-mkii) plugin and the lead tone is from their [Archetype: Petrucci](https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/archetype-petrucci) suite, both of which I got on a trial basis and I like a lot. (The Petrucci has a flanger, which I needed for the solo...)
>
> Huge props to [Uncle Ben Eller](https://www.youtube.com/BenEllerGuitars) for [his awesome lesson on how to play this song more better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qgBegbqSAo), and also to [Mark McGuigan at Master the Guitar](https://mastertheguitar.co.uk/) for [some extra finessing on the solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeJBZFEe24).
>
> Production note: the stems we had for this one removed (almost) all the guitar from the song, which meant that the solos were just kinda floating around with no rhythm guitar behind them. I recorded the rhythm parts on an extra track to fix this, but what you see in the video is one continuous take. Otherwise... a lot of it would be better. -->
