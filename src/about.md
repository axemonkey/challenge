## What's going on here, then?

Far, far back in the mists of time[^nineties], the Fiasco Brothers were in a band. They were 17 at the time. Then, time passed, and they were no longer in a band. More time passed, and they were once again in a band. You get the picture.

Nowadays they are no longer even in the same country and while they still play, they have very few opportunities to jam any more. This made them sad.

But lo! A splendid idea was forged. Why not come up with semi-regular challenges to keep them playing, and maybe even uploading video evidence to that popular video sharing site? In a spirit not of competition, but of encouragement and comradeship.

And they saw that it was good.

[^nineties]: The 1990s.
