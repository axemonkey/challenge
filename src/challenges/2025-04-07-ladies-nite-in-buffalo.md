## April 2025: Steve Vai’s solo from “Ladies’ Nite in Buffalo?” by David Lee Roth

* **The challenge**: "[Ladies' Nite in Buffalo?](https://song.link/gb/i/432798272)" from David Lee Roth's 1986 album **Eat 'Em and Smile** has a slow sultry groove and a fantastically slinky solo played by—of course—Steve Vai. Record a decent version of it start to finish, no comps, no filter.

### PF says:

> **Eat 'Em and Smile** is probably my favourite Vai, and this is one of his best. I've been playing it (wrong) for decades, so finally decided to sit down and get it as close as I can.

### CF says:

> This one took looooooads of takes to get even this close. For some reason the fast hammer-on section starting at 0:23 just wouldn't come together for me. I'm too out of practice.

> The tone is coming from Neural DSP's awesome [Soldano SLO-100 X](https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/soldano-slo-100) plugin, and the guitar is of course my original 1987 [Ibanez JEM777LNG](https://ibanez.fandom.com/wiki/JEM777).
