## May 2025: "Demon Alcohol" by Ozzy Osbourne

* **The challenge**: Last time saw the Brothers tackling "Bark at the Moon", featuring the excellent Jake E. Lee, so while they're in an Ozzy groove why not take on a Zakk Wylde-powered song? Why not indeed. "[Demon Alcohol](https://song.link/gb/i/190661778)", from Oswald's **No Rest For the Wicked** (1988) has been selected. Get to it, Bros.
