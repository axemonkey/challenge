## April 2025: The solo section from "Strange" by Joe Satriani

* **The challenge**: There are two frenetic solos stacked back-to-back in the middle of Satriani's "[Strange](https://song.link/gb/i/407604565)". That's right, it's a back-to-back Satch-attack stack track, Jack. Our heroes must play each solo end-to-end with no stitching, but it **is** OK if they are from separate takes.

### CF says:

> I just couldn't get the octavey slidey lick at the end of the first solo to come together at the right time, but this take had the best vibe I could muster. I'm pretty happy with it all round.

### PF says:

> **Flying in a Blue Dream** was the first Satriani album that I got as soon as it was released. I always loved this track, but had no idea how difficult the solo was going to be until I tried to learn it.
>
> That lick at 0:48 is proper nasty.
>
> And a dropped pick for the last trill.
>
> * Gibson Les Paul Custom with Bare Knuckle Rebel Yells
> * Synergy Bogner Ecstasy Red
