## April 2025: The solo section from "Strange" by Joe Satriani

* **The challenge**: There are two solos stacked back-to-back in the middle of Satch's "[Strange](https://song.link/gb/i/407604565)". Our heroes must play each solo end-to-end with no stitching, but it **is** OK if they are from separate takes.
