## May 2025: "Bark at the Moon" by Ozzy Osbourne

* **The challenge**: Jake E. Lee's magnificent octopus, "[Bark at the Moon](https://song.link/gb/i/192826926)", has been required reading for metal guitarists for around forty years. The Brothers must try to get the whole thing down in one go.

> I think I must have done four or five videos of this while waiting for PF, who has been busy saving lives in Africa[^africa]. Hey-ho, it gave me a chance to practice it up and get it better each time. It's still not perfect though ‚Äì the outro solo is a bit sloppier than I would like ‚Äì but the overall vibe is decent so I went with it.

> The guitar is once again the [not-Ibanez tribute JEM77WMC](https://blog.clivemurray.com/how-to-get-a-custom-guitar-in-just-9-years-and-lose-thousands-in-the-process/), the rhythm sound is coming from Neural DSP's [Mesa Boogie Mark IIC+](https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/tone-king-imperial-mkii) plugin and the lead tone is from their [Archetype: Petrucci](https://neuraldsp.com/plugins/archetype-petrucci) suite, both of which I got on a trial basis and I like a lot. (The Petrucci has a flanger, which I needed for the solo...)

> Huge props to [Uncle Ben Eller](https://www.youtube.com/BenEllerGuitars) for [his awesome lesson on how to play this song more better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qgBegbqSAo), and also to [Mark McGuigan at Master the Guitar](https://mastertheguitar.co.uk/) for [some extra finessing on the solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYeJBZFEe24).
>
> Production note: the stems we had for this song removed (almost) all the guitar from the recording, which meant that the solos were just kinda floating around with no rhythm guitar behind them, which is wrong. Jake recorded a rhythm track and a lead track over the top. I recorded the rhythm parts on an extra track to fix this, but what you see in the video is one continuous take.
